# anPysotropy
Repo for tools to calculate / plot fracturing and efficective medium models of anisotropy

AnPysotropy is a toolkit for modelling anisotropy (velocity and attenuation) for primarly fluid-filled fracture rock physics models

This brings together some previously published work on attenuation anisotorpy (Asplet et al., 2024) and a new implementation of the Zatespin et al., (1997) Anisotropic Poroelasticity model written by Mark Chapman. 

In the future we may add other MSAT-like features such as an elastic data base, VRH-averaging etc., to allow users to also work with LPO tensors.
